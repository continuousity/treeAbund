## Point-mutation speciation in the metacommunity

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE}
# function to simulate meta community abundance under 
# point mutation model of speciation

pointMutMeta <- function(theta, J) {
    # initialize with every lineage being one individual
    K <- J
    V <- rep(1, J)
    
    # this will hold the abundances of the final species
    W <- c()
    
    # loop until all lineages have coalesced
    while(K > 0) {
        # determines if we have speciation or coalescence
        r <- runif(1)
        
        # the lineage to which either event happens
        i <- sample(K, 1)
        
        # determine the event
        if(r <= theta / (theta + K - 1)) { # speciation
            W <- c(W, V[i])
            V <- V[-i]
        } else { # coalescence
            j <- sample((1:K)[-i], 1)
            V[i] <- V[i] + V[j]
            V <- V[-j]
        }
        
        # after either event, number of lineages is always 
        # one less
        K <- K - 1
    }
    
    return(W)
}

# try it out
x <- pointMutMeta(theta = 100, J = 10^4)

par(mar = c(3, 3, 0, 0) + 0.5, mgp = c(1.5, 0.5, 0))
plot(sort(x, TRUE), log = 'y', xlab = 'Species rank', ylab = 'Abundance')
```


## Protracted speciation in the metacommunity

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE}

```
